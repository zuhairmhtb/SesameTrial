Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is a pleasure for me to be here tonight and address such a great audience. The issue I would like to bring up threatens the prosperity and welfare of the whole nation, however, the majority of the population tends to ignore it and pretend as if it is not a problem at all. Namely, I would like to talk about the risks of obesity.

First of all, it would be reasonable to present the statistics that some of you might find shocking. To be more precise, in accordance with the data provided by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, the number of people suffering from obesity has already reached the point of 35% of the whole US population. Just imagine, one-third of Americans is particularly limited in their opportunities to have a happy, comprehensive, and productive life. Let me remind you, that the right to health was considered by the United Nations to be an integral element of the human rights and the individual dignity. I believe, that it is a high time to ask ourselves whether the lifestyle patterns cultivated in the US are actually contributing to the concept of human dignity or not. Unfortunately, the honest answer would rather disappoint us.
